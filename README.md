In this exploratory research I wish to investigate if there is racial bias in the grant of mortgage loans. Discrimination by race for mortgage applications would be unconstitutional in the USA and as such sufficient grounds for policy intervention


I use data released by the researchers at the federal reserve of Boston. The data set combines information from mortgage applications and and a follow-up survey of the banks and other lending institutions that received these applications. All data has to do with the mortgage applications from the greater Boston metropolitan area in 1990.
